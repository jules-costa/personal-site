        <p>Coverage Assessment is an insurance blog that began as a static Wordpress site. I recently rebuilt it from back to front in order to deepen my knowledge of Rails 5, Redux and React.js. After reaching MVP, I rethought my approach entirely. I wanted to simplify the codebase, improve the functionality, and polish the user experience. I created a second iteration in a few hours. The live site is constructed using a Hugo template (written in Go), and is deployed on Netlify with continuous integration.</p>
