    <p>Hey, I'm Jules. My core values are honest communication, compassion, purpose-driven learning and growth, self-care, creativity, and nurturing the growth of people around me.</p>
    <p>I'm a software engineer based in San Francisco. When I'm not coding you can find me riding my fixed-gear around the city, handpoking tattoos on friends, or most likely snuggling my cat, Kevin.</p>
    <p>My technical toolbox includes: Ruby, Rails, Redux, React.js, ES5, ES6, Postgres, SQL, HTML5, CSS3, SASS, Webpack/Babel & Heroku.</p>
    <p>I love discovering new and better ways to design and develop software. I have a keen eye for detail, and strive to produce clean, maintainable, scaleable code.</p>
    <p>I'm currently seeking opportunities in the Bay Area. Please email me at julesleighcosta@gmail.com if you'd like to connect!</p>
